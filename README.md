# MLP-DINO
This is the official code (based on Pytorch framework) for the paper "MLP-DINO: Category Modeling and Query Graphing with Deep MLP for Object Detection".

## Updates

***17/04/2024***

`News`: Our new work ``MLP-DINO: Category Modeling and Query Graphing with Deep MLP for Object Detection'' has been accepted to [IJCAI2024](https://ijcai24.org/). Strip-MLP is extended to be a strong backbone for downstream task of object detection. More information about Strip-MLP can be found in [Strip-MLP](https://github.com/Med-Process/Strip_MLP/tree/main).
